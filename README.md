# 1hour-experiment
Sarah used to have so many spoons when she was healthy, but now it's hard to read more than a few paragraphs when reading prose. Sarah is learning to manage her illness with help. She's been successful occasionally coding as long as she can write code that she can write off the top of her head. Sarah's cognitive difficulties include reading, which limits her capacity to do things like web searches. She would like to do more coding, though, and has had success with pairing.

This is an experiment because Sarah estimates she has 5 good hours a month and she's incredibly bored. She's inviting you to collaborate with her by opening an issue in this repository!

FYI this project is being launched on Sarah's birthday ðŸŽ‚ðŸ’–! Opening issues is the best present you can give!

Sarah's situation changes frequently, so sessions might be canceled last minute. It's also okay if your availablity changes from the times you say in the issues.

## How to collaborate with Sarah
Create an issue using one of the templates. Please try to keep it as brief as possible because reading is one of the things that is hard for Sarah right now. We provided some examples that indicate some of the things that Sarah is interested in, but please feel free to write whatever (as long as it's short)!
